abstract = {MYCIN is a computer-based consultation system designed to assist physicians in the diagnosis of and therapy selection for patients with bacterial infections. In addition to the consultation system itself, MYCIN contains an explanation system which can answer simple English questions in order to justify its advice or educate the user. The system's knowledge is encoded in the form of some 350 production rules which embody the clinical decision criteria of infectious disease experts. Much of MYCIN's power derives from the modular, highly stylized nature of these decision rules, enabling the system to dissect its own reasoning and allowing easy modification of the knowledge base.}

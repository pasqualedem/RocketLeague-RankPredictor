\section{Data understanding} \label{seq:data_understanding}

 In this step the objective is to consider the available data, understand their properties, check its quality and explore it through statistical methods.

 \subsection{Collect initial data}

The data is collected through a platform called \textit{ballchasing.com} that allows players to download a plugin for the game that will automatically load their replays to to platform.

The replays are then viewable into a web based frontend and is possible to analyze different statistics from the replay. The platform provides also different HTTP API:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Get replay: returns the binary replay file given the ID;
    \item Get replay list: returns a json involving summary of replays (including the ID to get the full replay) given different filters;
    \item Get replay statistics: returns a full detailed statistics of the game for each player given the replay ID;
    \item Upload replay: used by the plugin to upload replays;
    \item Delete replay.
\end{itemize}

It is important to clarify that a replay is not a video file as usual, but a large binary file containing various metadata on the match and the players and a table in which are listed all the information necessary to review the match.
Therefore, for each instant \textit{(frame)} of the game, are listed position, direction and velocity vector of each player and the ball, and also other information of the input the players (e.g. player is using boost, player is drifting, etc...).

Extracting features from the raw replays can be very challenging, and the amount of possible features is quite high. However, the main problem about raw replays is API limitations, as it is possible to download only 200 replays per hour. Instead, we can download the replay statistics, as they are very detailed and provide stats about all the players, furthermore the limitation is 2000 per hour.

Thus, in this project, we used the calculated stats from the APIs. Each downloaded replay is saved in a JSON file. These, are hierarchical files contain also a lot of metadata and other useless for our task information about the match (e.g. stadium, car personalization of each player etc...). We discarded this data and take the stats about the six players in the match, which then results in 6 rows for each replay.

Data was collected using \textit{random sampling} from the date. The date is sampled from a range starting from August 2021 until February 2022, that's because are the dates of the two last \textit{"Seasons"} of Rocket League. At the end of each season there is a soft reset of ranks: the MMR doesn't change but the players have to do again 10 matches where the MMR change at the end of the match is higher.
I decided to not consider older seasons because the \textit{playstyle} and the distribution of players in Rocket League changes over time.

However, we have to discard some player rows where the rank information was missing. This is due to the fact that the rank in that match wasn't determined yet.

\subsection{Describe data}

The resulting dataset counts \note{data len} rows. Let's examine the dataset statistics:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \resizebox{1.1\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{res/imgs/tiers.pdf}}
    \label{fig:rank_distr}
    \caption{Distribution of players ranks (blue) vs. distribution of ranks in data (orange)}
\end{figure}

We can notice that the the bronze class had very few examples. This has two main reasons, the first one is that there are actually very few players in bronze, it's very difficult to get there basing on how ranking system works. The second reason is that players in bronze are casuals players that even don't know about the plugin necessary to upload replays. We can see the distribution of ranks for the current season (Season 5) in \reffig{fig:rank_distr} (orange). In the same figure we can see in blue the actual distribution of players, that is more or less normally distributed and centered. The data distribution is instead shifted to the right; as we said, skilled players tends to use and know about the plugin.
